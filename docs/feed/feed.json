			"content_html": "<div class=\"message-box\">\n\t<p><em>This post was originally published on the <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/intl\">V8 blog</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://tc39.es/ecma402/\">The ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification</a> (ECMA-402, or <code>Intl</code>) provides key locale-specific functionality such as date formatting, number formatting, plural form selection, and collation. The Chrome V8 and Google Internationalization teams have been collaborating on adding features to V8’s ECMA-402 implementation, while cleaning up technical debt and improving performance and interoperability with other browsers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"underlying-architectural-improvements\" tabindex=\"-1\">Underlying architectural improvements <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/intl/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Initially the ECMA-402 spec was implemented mostly in JavaScript using V8-extensions and lived outside the V8 codebase. Using the external Extension API meant that several of V8’s internally used APIs for type checking, lifetime management of external C++ objects and internal private data storage couldn’t be used. As part of improving startup performance, this implementation was later moved in to the V8 codebase to enable <a href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/custom-startup-snapshots\">snapshotting</a> of these builtins.</p>\n<p>V8 uses specialized <code>JSObject</code>s with custom <a href=\"https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics\">shapes (hidden classes)</a> to describe built-in JavaScript objects specified by ECMAScript (like <code>Promise</code>s, <code>Map</code>s, <code>Set</code>s, etc). With this approach, V8 can pre-allocate the required number of internal slots and generate fast accesses to these, rather than grow the object one property at a time leading to slower performance and worse memory usage.</p>\n<p>The <code>Intl</code> implementation was not modeled after such an architecture, as a consequence of the historic split. Instead, all the built-in JavaScript objects as specified by the Internationalization spec (like <code>NumberFormat</code>, <code>DateTimeFormat</code>) were generic <code>JSObject</code>s that had to transition through several property additions for their internal slots.</p>\n<p>Another artifact of not having a specialized <code>JSObject</code>s was that type checking was now more complex. The type information was stored under a private symbol and type-checked on both the JS and C++ side using expensive property access, rather than just looking up its shape.</p>\n<h3 id=\"modernizing-the-codebase\" tabindex=\"-1\">Modernizing the codebase <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/intl/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With the current move away from writing self-hosted builtins in V8, it made sense to use this opportunity to modernize the ECMA402 implementation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"moving-away-from-self-hosted-js\" tabindex=\"-1\">Moving away from self-hosted JS <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/intl/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Although self-hosting lends itself to concise and readable code, the frequent usage of slow runtime calls to access ICU APIs led to performance issues. As a result, a lot of ICU functionality was duplicated in JavaScript to reduce the number of such runtime calls.</p>\n<p>By rewriting the builtins in C++, it became much faster to access the ICU APIs as there is no runtime call overhead now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improving-icu\" tabindex=\"-1\">Improving ICU <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/intl/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>ICU is a set of C/C++ libraries used by a large set of applications, including all the major JavaScript engines, for providing Unicode and globalization support. As part of switching <code>Intl</code> to ICU in V8’s implementation, we <a href=\"https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20140\">found</a> <a href=\"https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-9562\">and</a> <a href=\"https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20098\">fixed</a> several ICU bugs.</p>\n<p>As part of implementing new proposals such as <a href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/features/intl-relativetimeformat\"><code>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat</code></a>, <a href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/features/intl-listformat\"><code>Intl.ListFormat</code></a> and <code>Intl.Locale</code>, we’ve extended ICU by adding <a href=\"https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13256\">several</a> <a href=\"https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20121\">new</a> <a href=\"https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20342\">APIs</a> to support these new ECMAScript proposals.</p>\n<p>All of these additions help other JavaScript engines implement these proposals quicker now, pushing the web forward! For example, development is in progress in Firefox on implementing several new <code>Intl</code> APIs based on our ICU work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\" tabindex=\"-1\">Performance <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/intl/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As a result of this work, we improved the performance of the Internationalization API by optimizing several fast paths and caching the initialization of the various <code>Intl</code> objects and the <code>toLocaleString</code> methods on <code>Number.prototype</code>, <code>Date.prototype</code>, and <code>String.prototype</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, creating a new <code>Intl.NumberFormat</code> object became around 24× faster.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/1oz8K5m7ve-713.avif 713w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/1oz8K5m7ve-713.webp 713w\"><img alt=\"Microbenchmarks testing the performance of creating various `Intl` objects\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/1oz8K5m7ve-713.svg\" width=\"713\" height=\"371\"></picture></p>\n<p>Note that for better performance, it’s recommended to explicitly create <em>and reuse</em> an <code>Intl.NumberFormat</code> or <code>Intl.DateTimeFormat</code> or <code>Intl.Collator</code> object, rather than calling methods like <code>toLocaleString</code> or <code>localeCompare</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-intl-features\" tabindex=\"-1\">New <code>Intl</code> features <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/intl/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>All of this work has provided a great foundation to build new features on and we’re continuing to ship all the new Internationalization proposals that are in Stage 3.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/features/intl-relativetimeformat\"><code>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat</code></a> has shipped in Chrome 71, <a href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/features/intl-listformat\"><code>Intl.ListFormat</code></a> has shipped in Chrome 72, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Locale\"><code>Intl.Locale</code></a> has shipped in Chrome 74, and <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-datetime-style\"><code>dateStyle</code> and <code>timeStyle</code> options for <code>Intl.DateTimeFormat</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/236\">BigInt support for <code>Intl.DateTimeFormat</code></a> are shipping in Chrome 76. <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange\"><code>Intl.DateTimeFormat#formatRange</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter/\"><code>Intl.Segmenter</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat/\">additional options for <code>Intl.NumberFormat</code></a> are currently under development in V8, and we hope to ship them soon!</p>\n<p>Many of these new APIs, and others further down the pipeline, are due to our work on standardizing new features to help developers with internationalization. <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-displaynames\"><code>Intl.DisplayNames</code></a> is a Stage 1 proposal that allows users to localize the display names of language, region or script display names. <a href=\"https://github.com/fabalbon/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange\"><code>Intl.DateTimeFormat#formatRange</code></a> is a Stage 3 proposal that specifies a way to format date ranges in a concise and locale-aware manner. <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat\">The unified <code>Intl.NumberFormat</code> API proposal</a> is a Stage 3 proposal that improves <code>Intl.NumberFormat</code> by adding support for measurement units, currency and sign display policies, and scientific and compact notation. You can get involved in the future of ECMA-402 as well, by contributing at <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/ecma402\">its GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusion <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/intl/\">#</a></h2>\n<p><code>Intl</code> provides a feature-rich API for several operations needed in internationalizing your web app, leaving the heavy lifting to the browser, without shipping as much data or code over the wire. Thinking through the proper use of these APIs can lead your UI to work better in different locales. Due to the work by the Google V8 and i18n teams in collaboration with TC39 and its ECMA-402 subgroup, you can now access more functionality with better performance, and expect further improvements over time.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<div class=\"message-box\">\n\t<p><em>This post was originally published on the <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/hash-code\">V8 blog</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>ECMAScript 2015 introduced several new data structures such as Map, Set, WeakSet, and WeakMap, all of which use hash tables under the hood. This post details the <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=6404\">recent improvements</a> in how <a href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/v8-release-63\">V8 v6.3+</a> stores the keys in hash tables.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hash-code\" tabindex=\"-1\">Hash code <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/hash-code/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\"><em>hash function</em></a> is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table. A <em>hash code</em> is the result of running this hash function over a given key.</p>\n<p>In V8, the hash code is just a random number, independent of the object value. Therefore, we can’t recompute it, meaning we must store it.</p>\n<p>For JavaScript objects that were used as keys, previously, the hash code was stored as a private symbol on the object. A private symbol in V8 is similar to a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol\"><code>Symbol</code></a>, except that it’s not enumerable and doesn’t leak to userspace JavaScript.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">GetObjectHash</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">key</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> hash <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> key<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>hashCodeSymbol<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token constant\">IS_UNDEFINED</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>hash<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t\thash <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token function\">MathRandom</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x40000000</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\t\t<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>hash <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> hash <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\t\tkey<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>hashCodeSymbol<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> hash<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\t<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\t<span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> hash<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>This worked well because we didn’t have to reserve memory for a hash code field until the object was added to a hash table, at which point a new private symbol was stored on the object.</p>\n<p>V8 could also optimize the hash code symbol lookup just like any other property lookup using the IC system, providing very fast lookups for the hash code. This works well for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching#Monomorphic_inline_caching\">monomorphic IC lookups</a>, when the keys have the same <a href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/\">hidden class</a>. However, most real-world code doesn’t follow this pattern, and often keys have different hidden classes, leading to slow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching#Megamorphic_inline_caching\">megamorphic IC lookups</a> of the hash code.</p>\n<p>Another problem with the private symbol approach was that it triggered a <a href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/#fast-property-access\">hidden class transition</a> in the key on storing the hash code. This resulted in poor polymorphic code not just for the hash code lookup but also for other property lookups on the key and <a href=\"https://floitsch.blogspot.com/2012/03/optimizing-for-v8-inlining.html\">deoptimization</a> from optimized code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"javascript-object-backing-stores\" tabindex=\"-1\">JavaScript object backing stores <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/hash-code/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A JavaScript object (<code>JSObject</code>) in V8 uses two words (apart from its header): one word for storing a pointer to the elements backing store, and another word for storing a pointer to the properties backing store.</p>\n<p>The elements backing store is used for storing properties that look like <a href=\"https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array-index\">array indices</a>, whereas the properties backing store is used for storing properties whose keys are strings or symbols. See this <a href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/fast-properties\">V8 blog post</a> by Camillo Bruni for more information about these backing stores.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nx<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"bar\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// ← stored in elements</span>\nx<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"foo\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"bar\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// ← stored in properties</span></code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"hiding-the-hash-code\" tabindex=\"-1\">Hiding the hash code <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/hash-code/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The easiest solution to storing the hash code would be to extend the size of a JavaScript object by one word and store the hash code directly on the object. However, this would waste memory for objects that aren’t added to a hash table. Instead, we could try to store the hash code in the elements store or properties store.</p>\n<p>The elements backing store is an array containing its length and all the elements. There’s not much to be done here, as storing the hashcode in a reserved slot (like the 0th index) would still waste memory when we don’t use the object as a key in a hash table.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the properties backing store. There are two kinds of data structures used as a properties backing store: arrays and dictionaries.</p>\n<p>Unlike the array used in the elements backing store which does not have an upper limit, the array used in the properties backing store has an upper limit of 1022 values. V8 transitions to using a dictionary on exceeding this limit for performance reasons. (I’m slightly simplifying this — V8 can also use a dictionary in other cases, but there is a fixed upper limit on the number of values that can be stored in the array.)</p>\n<p>So, there are three possible states for the properties backing store:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>empty (no properties)</li>\n<li>array (can store up to 1022 values)</li>\n<li>dictionary</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s discuss each of these.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-properties-backing-store-is-empty\" tabindex=\"-1\">The properties backing store is empty <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/hash-code/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>For the empty case, we can directly store the hash code in this offset on the <code>JSObject</code>.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/wAsJyBpUBW-323.avif 323w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/wAsJyBpUBW-323.webp 323w\"><img alt=\"a graph\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/wAsJyBpUBW-323.png\" width=\"323\" height=\"160\"></picture></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-properties-backing-store-is-an-array\" tabindex=\"-1\">The properties backing store is an array <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/hash-code/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>V8 represents integers less than 2<sup>31</sup> (on 32-bit systems) unboxed, as <a href=\"https://wingolog.org/archives/2011/05/18/value-representation-in-javascript-implementations\">Smi</a>s. In a Smi, the least significant bit is a tag used to distinguish it from pointers, while the remaining 31 bits hold the actual integer value.</p>\n<p>Normally, arrays store their length as a Smi. Since we know that the maximum capacity of this array is only 1022, we only need 10 bits to store the length. We can use the remaining 21 bits to store the hash code!</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/DSYtSz1nW7-491.avif 491w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/DSYtSz1nW7-491.webp 491w\"><img alt=\"a graph\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/DSYtSz1nW7-491.png\" width=\"491\" height=\"322\"></picture></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-properties-backing-store-is-a-dictionary\" tabindex=\"-1\">The properties backing store is a dictionary <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/hash-code/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>For the dictionary case, we increase the dictionary size by 1 word to store the hashcode in a dedicated slot at the beginning of the dictionary. We get away with potentially wasting a word of memory in this case, because the proportional increase in size isn’t as big as in the array case.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/YDT1jhWCfY-446.avif 446w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/YDT1jhWCfY-446.webp 446w\"><img alt=\"a graph\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/YDT1jhWCfY-446.png\" width=\"446\" height=\"214\"></picture></p>\n<p>With these changes, the hash code lookup no longer has to go through the complex JavaScript property lookup machinery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance-improvements\" tabindex=\"-1\">Performance improvements <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/hash-code/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kpdecker/six-speed\">SixSpeed</a> benchmark tracks the performance of Map and Set, and these changes resulted in a ~500% improvement.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/wEfBvRvGlO-1999.avif 1999w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/wEfBvRvGlO-1999.webp 1999w\"><img alt=\"a graph\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/wEfBvRvGlO-1999.png\" width=\"1999\" height=\"386\"></picture></p>\n<p>This change caused a 5% improvement on the Basic benchmark in <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/7536/jsc-loves-es6/\">ARES6</a> as well.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/hskYCYhgJ4-1999.avif 1999w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/hskYCYhgJ4-1999.webp 1999w\"><img alt=\"a graph\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/hskYCYhgJ4-1999.png\" width=\"1999\" height=\"505\"></picture></p>\n<p>This also resulted in an 18% improvement in one of the benchmarks in the <a href=\"http://emberperf.eviltrout.com/\">Emberperf</a> benchmark suite that tests Ember.js.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/KpLBt1XS4c-1987.avif 1987w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/KpLBt1XS4c-1987.webp 1987w\"><img alt=\"a graph\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.recompiled.dev/img/KpLBt1XS4c-1987.jpeg\" width=\"1987\" height=\"609\"></picture></p>\n",
